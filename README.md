# EEG_AuditoryLocaliser
This is the EEG experimental code to present brief pure tones (>=180 tones, f=500Hz, duration=150ms). Tones are presented with an inter-sound interval randomised between 1 and 1.5 seconds. Participants are instructed to count the number of pure tones with their eyes naturally opened. 

## Special notes
1. The EEG used here is 64 channel Biosemi system (Biosemi Active Two AD-box ADC-17, Biosemi, Netherlands).
2. You need Psychtoolbox to run this experimental script (http://psychtoolbox.org/).
2. There is one line in this script you must update based on your setup: soundcard channels. Search '#CHANGETHIS#'.
