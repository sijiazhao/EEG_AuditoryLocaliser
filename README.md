EEG auditory localiser

## What's this for?
This is the EEG experimental code to present brief pure tones (>=180 tones, f=500Hz, duration=150ms). Tones are presented with an inter-sound interval randomised between 1 and 1.5 seconds. Participants are instructed to count the number of pure tones with their eyes naturally opened. 
EEG: 64 channel Biosemi system (Biosemi Active Two AD-box ADC-17, Biosemi, Netherlands)

## Special notes
